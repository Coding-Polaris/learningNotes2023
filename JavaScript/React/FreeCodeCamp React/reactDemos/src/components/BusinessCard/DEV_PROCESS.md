Looks like:

One large dark-mode container housing all the components and sub-containers

Profile pic - probably just needs to be an <img>, doesn't need its own component

### These three could be a component section; the BasicInfo:

1. A huge header that's the dev's name

2. A smaller, different-color header with her profession

3. finally, the smallest text as her website

Next, two **buttons** with an image, text, custom bg color, and links to email and linkedin, respectively

Then, two **headed sections** with a header and a paragraph -- both have the same styling, so it's just the content that varies --

And finally, *a darker social media section with four social media buttons*

So something like six types of components and about eleven components total.
